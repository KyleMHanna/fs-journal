# The fetch API

**What is a XMLHttpRequest?**
XMLHttpRequest object is used to retrieve data from a server asynchronously.


**What are some ways fetch improves on standard XML requests?**
Fetch makes it easier to make asynchronous requests and handle responses better than with the older XMLHttpRequest.
It is an improvement over the XMLHttpRequest API in both complexity and functionality. The main difference between Fetch and XMLHttpRequest is that the Fetch API uses Promises, hence avoiding callback hell.

**What is the options object used for with a fetch request?**

When a promise is resolved we get a Response object in return in order to get data from the response we need to get the body of the repsonse. Since the body returns JSON the returned response will have have to use the .json() method.
