REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.

**What does Stateless mean?**
Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API. It doesn't remember if the user of the API already sent a GET request for the same resource in the past, it doesn't remember which resources the user of the API requested before, and so on.

**What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?**
Uniform interface
Client --- server separation
