# Vue3 Nested Routes


**What are lifecycle hooks?**

Lifecycle hooks are a window into how the library you're using works behind-the-scenes. Lifecycle hooks allow you to know when your component is created, added to the DOM, updated, or destroyed.


**What are lifecycle hooks used for?**

They allow you to perform actions before your component has even been added to the DOM.


**What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?**

Mounting hooks are often the most used hooks. They allow you to access your component immediately before and after the first render. They do not, however, run during server-side rendering.

You would use mounting hooks if you need to access or modify the DOM of your component immediately before or after the initial render.
