# Mongoose 101

**In simple terms what is a sub-document?**

Subdocuments are documents that are nested in another document.


**When might you use a sub-document?**

When you have a large document or file and want to be able to find specifics or drill down into certain things and edit them.


**How do you add to a collection of sub-documents? What about editing them?**

When you want to add or create an item you are creating a character by doing the New Character = and then you would save the addition. When editing you would use the find one to find the document  you are looking for to get the array make the change and save.
