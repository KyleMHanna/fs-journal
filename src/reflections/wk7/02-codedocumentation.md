There are a lot of ways you can leave notes that are benificial. I usually will leave a note if its something complicated or if its something I need to come back to.

**What are some benefits of Code Documentation?**

Helps your team and whoever else is looking at the code. Helps you remember things you need to come back to and fix later down the road.

**How important is Code documentation and why?**

I think it very important because it helps keep everyone on the same page and quite honestly my last group checkpoint no one  was on the same page so from my own experiences I can see how crucial leaving documentation really is.
