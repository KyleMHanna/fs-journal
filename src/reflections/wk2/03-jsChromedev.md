# Chrome Developer Tools

**What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.**

The main ways are through the elements tab that has a ton of things you can manipulate so you adjust things on the fly even scroll up or down on percentages or number values to get an idea on what they will do. Once you figure out exactly what you want you are able to just copy and paste to your code. 


**Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?**

The Elements tab, which allows you to directly look at and manipulate the HTML elements and CSS on the DOM -- what you change in this tab will be immediately and directly updated in the page you are viewing. Feel free to test things here, they won't be saved upon refresh unless you also modify them in your code.

**Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?**
You can throw a debug code in a fuction if that function doesnt do exactly what you want it to do. 
You can also debug your code and use the dev tool to go step by step through the functions
