# Mistakes I made as a noob

**What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?**

* The wireframing/planning is vital to any project. Especially if you want it to look a certain way. Similar to how someone who is doing a custom water loop on a computer you have to plan everything out all the way down to the bends and flow, so you know how many fittings you are going to need along with tubing. 

* If you don't have a plan, you don't have a sense of direction when you get "lost in the sauce"

* I have quickly learned that organization is so vital when it comes to coding and a layout or blueprint is at the tip top of that list.

**How do you find answers when you are stuck?**

* I use my resources as best I can like google if I dont know how to do something or how to write something. Then I look to the dev tools to and take my code step by step to see where itâ€™s messing up. 

**From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?**

* Make sure you are picking the right tool for the job. Being able to adapt and open to new tools instead of being stuck in your way with the tools you know well. "You can build a house with primitive tools and take your sweet time or you can invest some time and money in good tools and build a better house much faster." Look at every code review as a learning opportunity. TEST TEST TEST console.log() SMALL STATES OF DONE
