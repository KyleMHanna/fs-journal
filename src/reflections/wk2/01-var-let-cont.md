**What is Scope ?**

Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use.


**What is Hoisting ?**

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

**In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?**

var I would use when I need to declare something multple times within a function. If something does not need to be defined more than once in a function let is the prefered variable declaration now and let is blocked scope. Const is something you would use if need something to be precise and exact to what you declare it to no if ands or buts.
