# Functions in java

**What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?**

A Function Declaration:
function name(parameters) {
   
}

A Function Expressions:
let name = function(parameters) {
    
}

An Arrow Function Expression:
let name = (parameters) => {
  
}


**What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?**

Parameters are used when defining a function.
Arguments, on the other hand, are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed



**What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?**

When a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function, it is called a higher-order function.

Array.prototype.filter is one we use in the excersise questions today.
