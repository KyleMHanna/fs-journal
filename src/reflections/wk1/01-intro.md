**What are the benefits of having multiple branches?**

* The benefit of having multiple branches allows developers to work on several projects that use the same codebase, so it allows them to reverence/use those in parallel with everything they are doing.

**What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

* Git is a local repository that multiple developers can utilize and work on in parrel with each other without conflicting or causing issues with each other’s work.  A version control system like git allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.
