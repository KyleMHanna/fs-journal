# You got style-css 

**What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use**


* a CSS Psuedo class is a keyword that can be added to a selector that specifies something throughout the whole code.
You can use a Psuedo class for something like a color theme or backround theme. 

**What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?**
*  If there are more than one conflicting CSS rules that point to the same elemement, CSS follows the specificity rules to determine which element to follow. Think of it as a scoring system and the most specific rule for that element wins. 

**What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?**

*  The !important feature in CSS is used to override any existing code for one particular element. This makes it significantly more difficult to stylize specific elements within CSS. The only way only way to override the !important feature is to add another !important feature which can get messy.
