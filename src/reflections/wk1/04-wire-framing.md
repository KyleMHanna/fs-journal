# Structure then build your way to success

**What is the purpose of wire-framing?**

*The purpose of wire-framing is to do a mockup or blueprint of your layout. 

**What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?**

*  Low-fidelity wireframes, mid-fidelity wireframes, and high-fidelity. They each have their own use case. 
* Each type has a higher level in detail. 


**Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?**

* Wire frames are worth the time, energy, and effort times 1000%. I wonâ€™t be doing a mock project without a wireframe of some sort to start. Especially at the learning stages I think it is a vital part of the process. Once I hone my skills and get better, I could see my self not using them as often.
