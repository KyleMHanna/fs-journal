# Keep it simple stupid

**What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?**

*  I felt that mirroring your layout as best you can with bootstrap was the best tip. Doing this allows you to get everything were you want it and then start making tweaks to tighten things up as needed. I also really liked using a box shadow, makes things look more modern. 

**Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.**

* Using fewer borders and using box shadows. Accent borders to add color to a bland design. Coloring primary actions, secondary actions, and tertiery actions accordingly takes little effort but has a lot of value when it comes to the user understanding what those buttons or "actions" do.

**How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?**

* I think good design influence is very very important. A good design can make up for sub-par functionality when it comes to how the site is perceived. There definitely must be a balance for design and functionality. You can convey the importance of different actions through design alone or functionality like a start button being green and stop being red.
