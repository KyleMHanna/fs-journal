#  Javascript Proxy Objects


**What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?**
 The get operator and the set operator. 
**What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?**
  Create a Proxy of this object, and override the get operator to prevent us from accessing the id property!
**What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?**
 They keep everything secure so the end user cannot access things we do not want them to see. I can see this being extremly important for any business or company.
