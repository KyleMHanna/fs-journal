it solves A LOT of security issues when it comes to someone getting access to sensitive infomation.

it allows you do quickly pull like a "blueprint" of a class to import quickly and plug in or compare values of another. 

**How does export differ from export default?**
Exporting default just allows to pull the defined funtion or object by their orignal set name. Exporting differ is when you can change the name or function to be hidden or even shorten things. 

**What is a benefit of using the Module System?**

Using the module system allows you to quickly make set "blueprints" or data sets then allowing different levels of access to the code or values for the developer. You can quickly compare things from a data set or entries. There are a lot of benefits to the system based on what you are developing.
