# The Observer Pattern 

## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

It's designed for data binding code between elements so you can keep track and sync everything in your code. It is extremely useful when you are building something that requires a lot of your events to be in sync from element to element. 

## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The Event Observer
The Subscribe Method
The Unsubscribe Method

## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

Seeing the potential and use cases for this pattern makes a lot more sense now that I have gonne through a few projects using this concept.
Being able to update/Manage things manipulate your html "dom" that is reactive to the end user is awesome.
